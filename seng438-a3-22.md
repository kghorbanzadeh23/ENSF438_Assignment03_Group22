# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

For our code coverage tool we chose to use EclEmma in Eclipse because it was the recommended tool as per the lab, as well as being very easy to integrate into our IDE, making it easy to use without much setup. It supports key coverage metrics like line, method, and branch coverage, which are sufficient for our project's needs. EclEmma provides real time feedback within the IDE, showing us which lines and branches are covered, which allows for immediate visibility and very easy analysis into the effectiveness of the tests we wrote. EclEmma does have some limitations, such as the lack of support for condition coverage (can be replaced with method coverage), which could have provided more detailed insights into the decision points in our code. Additionally, while the tool is lightweight and fast, it doesn't offer advanced customization or detailed reporting like some other tools do such as JaCoCo or Cobertura. Despite these drawbacks, we decided on using EclEmma due to its simplicity, ease of integration for Eclipse, and the fact that it met the basic coverage requirements for our project.

The suggested metrics to report from the lab were statement, branch, and condition coverages. Since we are using EclEmma, which does not support condition coverage, we opted to replace it with method coverage. This decision was made because method coverage still provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of testing by ensuring that each method in the code has been executed. While condition coverage maye have offered us a deeper analysis into decision points, method coverage serves as a practical substitution.

Pros: Simple integration with Eclipse, supports required coverage metrics (line, method (condition substitute), branch), gives real time in IDE feedback, lightweight and fast, free and open-source.
Cons: Lacks condition coverage, limited customization and reporting options, not as actively updated or feature-rich as other coverage tools like JaCoCo, only suitable for Java projects.
